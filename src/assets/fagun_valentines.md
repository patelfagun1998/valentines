Dear Dhanushikka,

Babe, I am sorry about leaving the writing of this letter to such a last moment. In fact, it is 4:27 am on the 14th as I am eriting this! But I could not want it any other way. I need to describe what an incredible priviledge it has been getting to, at first, live so close to you and now, to live with you. I feel truly lucky to feel the love that you give me and to call you my fiance (future wifey tho!!! (I am a little tipsy hehe))

The last six months of living together have had their incredible highs and some lows. For the lows, I apologize, and I promise to keep getting better at being your partner and your lover. But man, the highs have been so incredible. This is truly one of the happiest times of my life—the engagement party, hosting our friends together, snuggling up to watch movies (especially those incredible Telugu films I never would’ve discovered without you).

These moments exist because you are in my life. You take care of so much of the "unseen" stuff—the decor, the recipes, the themes for the parties—the things that actually bring life and joy to the world. You bring that joy to me. My life would be grey without you.

I am so excited for the year we have in front of us. We are both hitting our strides and working hard, and I know we’ll end this year in an even better spot than we started. I’m so glad I get to be on this journey with you.

I love you so much!

Fagun
