## Site Structure

### 1. Entry Page (Password Gate)
**Concept**: Cute doorway - like knocking on a decorated door
- Scrapbook-style decorated door/gift box visual
- "Are you Dhanushikka?" button with bouncing heart
- Password field appears styled as a little note pinned to the door
- Password: "I love Fagun"
- Wrong password = door shakes playfully
- Correct = door opens with confetti burst

### 2. Letter Page (Landing after login)
**Concept**: Heart explosion into vintage letter
- Animated heart floats to center, pulses, then bursts
- Letter unfolds from the explosion - old parchment texture
- Cursive/handwritten font for letter content
- Wax seal detail, torn edges, coffee stain texture
- Content: TBD (you'll provide later)

**Concept**: Horizontal scrollable timeline
- Key relationship milestones with dates
- Each milestone as a decorated scrapbook entry
- Stickers, washi tape decorations, handwritten labels
